git pull remote branch

used to pull the changes made in the remote repository
used in
1. Made changes to remote repo using github.
2. Made changes to remote repo using another device.
3. Some other collaborator(s) made changes to the remote repo.

Advantages of git's manual pull vs automatic
1. The collaborator has flexibility to update.
2. Automatic pull could have made some changes which the dev doesnt need.

Disadvantages.

Fork works only for GitHub it is made so that the original author gets credit
for his/her code.
Also it clones original github repo to user's repo.

clone it is a feature of git.

branch it is a label given to a commit used mainly to add experimental features.

git resolves out of sync i.e atleast one comits on both sides using merge

not git pull origin master is same as
git fetch origin/master
git merge master origin/master

now some errors might occur during merges this is because of same reason as the
merge error when merging branches so resolve the conflicts and error will fix.

now sometimes these errors may not occur then it is called Fast-forward merges
i.e no branch like structure is formed or commit is ahead/behind only in one
branch.
