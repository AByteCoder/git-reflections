git init is used to create repository
git add is used to add files to staging area
git status is used to view status of files present in working directory.

Terminology
working directory the present directory (visible to user)
staging area used by git for add command i.e changes to be commited at laterstate
repository contains files from staging area when it is committed later using
git commit

git diff without parameters is used to compare the staging area with
working directory
git diff --staged compares choosen commit with the staging area

One commit per logical change
this can be done by
1. deciding the change to make
2. make the change to the required files
3. add the changes to stages area.
4. commit the changes

Why is branches used
1. enables to work on an experimental feature without modifying the current code
2. fixing bugs i.e new branch is used so the master branch may not be introduced
with new bugs when resolving a current one.
3. enables to work on different versions like english,hindi language etc.
4. allows to switch to other branches when bored with the work.

How to create branches
git branch branch-name

View All branches
git branch

Note : * prefix indicates selected branch

To choose or checkout a branch
git checkout branch-name

git merge branch [....branches]
merges the branch with the current checked out branch.
how it works
in the tree diagram
1. it looks the latest common ancestor both possess
2. if new changes are present in one branch but not in another it adds
3. if same changes are present it adds.
4. if the changes are different then conflict occurs.
5. if the line is removed then it is removed in branch thing.

to revert the merge we can use --abort option
i.e in case of a conflict use
git merge --abort
