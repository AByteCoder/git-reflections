version control applications
restore to any point in time of the file

applications which use version control.
1.Dropbox keeps changes made to a file for 30 days
2. Google docs allows you to view all changes made to file and restore it too
that point in time.
3. Wikipedia allows to view previous versions of the documents.

version control for efficiency.
1. allows to move to a previous version of the code file.
2. allows for easy comparisions between versions of the file.
3. allows for easy debugging if one version of code works and another doesnt.

advantages of using manual commits vs auto commit
1. more flexibility to choose when to commit.
2. great for looking through the file for each new feature upgrade
3. versions are logically sound to look at.

disadvantages
1. Not automatic
2. Sometimes user may forget to manually commit the changes.

lessons learnt
1. People don't learn from their experience
2. They learn by reflecting on their experience

git diff is used to compare between different versions of commit.
git diff [commit_id_old] [commit_id_new]

git log gives out the commit log
git log --stat tells how many modifications, how many files got changed etc.
